# IGME-340 In-Class Work Repositories

## Purpose
This repository is your personal archive for in-class coding exercises. Keep your work here for studying, reviewing concepts, and preparing for projects and assessments.

## The Reward
- **Perfect Participation Metric:** Complete enough of these to earn 5% of your overall grade. I will drop at least 1.
- üéÅ **BONUS:** Earn 10 extra points to apply to any project when you complete enough assignments that adequately demonstrate what we covered in class.

**Each class session has its own GitHub Classroom assignment with a dedicated repository.**

---

## How It Works

### During Class:
- Follow along with the in-class demonstration
- **Don't worry if your code doesn't match exactly** - just demonstrate the major topics covered
- Each day's notes list the topics we covered; show basic understanding of each one
- Submit using one of the two methods described below

### After Class:
- If you fell behind or want more practice, you can work on this after class
- Visit the FULL notes for the day and complete on your own time
- The notes provide guidance and code examples, but you still need to put the pieces together and submit

> **Full Lecture Notes:** Available in MyCourses (ex: 6A Notes, 7B Notes) or directly on GitHub: https://github.com/jptweb/IGME-340-Shared/blob/main/weekly/

### Before Next Class:
Submit your work using **one of two methods**:

---

## Submission Method 1: Copy Main.dart Only (Recommended - Takes 30 Seconds!)

**Use GitHub's website - no cloning needed!**

1. Go to your repo on GitHub.com (created when you accepted the assignment)
2. Click on `main.dart`
3. Click the pencil icon (‚úèÔ∏è Edit)
4. Delete existing code and paste your code from today's class
5. Scroll down and click **"Commit changes"**
6. Add a commit message like "Completed Week 7A work"
7. Click **"Commit changes"** again

**Done!** Your code is saved and I can see your progress.

## Submission Method 2: Full Flutter Project (Optional)

If you prefer to keep the complete project structure:

### Option A: Using GitHub Desktop (Recommended)
1. Clone your assignment repo using GitHub Desktop
2. Copy your entire Flutter project folder into the repo
3. **Important:** Copy the `.gitignore` file from the repo into your project folder (if not already there)
4. Use GitHub Desktop to commit and push

### Option B: Command Line
```bash
git clone [your-assignment-repo-url]
cd [repo-name]
# Copy your project folder into the repo
# Make sure .gitignore is present!
git add .
git commit -m "Added Week 7A work"
git push origin main
```

**Note:** The `.gitignore` prevents uploading build files (would be 450+ MB without it!)

---

## Grading & Bonus

- **Worth:** 5% of your final grade (participation metric)
- üéÅ **BONUS:** Get **10 extra points** on any project of your choice!
- **Requirement:** Complete most in-class assignments (I will drop at least 1; exact number TBD)
- **Due:** Before the start of next class (if you follow along in class, you can submit right away)
- **Standard:** Good effort and progress - doesn't need to be perfect, but should demonstrate concepts covered in lecture

## Quick Tips

‚úÖ **Method 1 is easiest** - just copy/paste on GitHub.com  
‚úÖ **Accept each assignment** when posted (new repo each class day)  
‚úÖ **Show good effort** - doesn't need to be perfect  
‚úÖ **Submit within 24 hours** while material is fresh  
‚úÖ **Use weekly notes** if you miss class or fall behind

‚ùå **Don't commit without `.gitignore`** if using Method 2 (creates huge repo)  
‚ùå **Don't skip accepting assignments** - you need a repo for each class  
‚ùå **Don't wait until end of semester** - submit as you go

## Questions?

- **During Class:** Ask me directly
- **Slack:** Post in `#section-01` 
- **Email:** jxtadm@rit.edu (subject: IGME-340 - GitHub Question)

*Remember: Each class has its own assignment/repo. Method 1 (copy/paste on website) is perfectly fine and takes seconds. Just show good progress and effort!*
